# Printing Framester

For printing Framester, you need the following things:

1) The front side of the cards, which contain the Movie screenshots.
For this, you can choose the '*Prepare files for printing*' option in the startup menu.
A script will be executed and each screenshot will be downloaded and processed.
You can find them in the '*printing/front*' folder, cropped and resized to 1122x822.
You can adapt the size in the *printing_manager.py*
2) The back side of the cards, which contain the Movie metadata.
These are commited in the repository and are found in the '*printing/back*' folder.
Currently, they are generated anew every time the option in the startup menu is chosen.
Their default size is the same as for the front (obviously).
3) A printing service of your choice. 
I used [MakePlayingCard](https://www.makeplayingcards.com/) and ordered *Custom Game Cards (63 x 88mm) Playing Cards*.
There you can add the fronts and backs automatically, using the name of the image file to combine the front to the correct back.
